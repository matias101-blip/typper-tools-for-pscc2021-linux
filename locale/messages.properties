    <p>This extension was created for simplifying the routine tasks of working with text, such as placing it on an image, aligning the text and performing style management. It allows you to:</p>\
        <ul><li>Customize list of Styles, which could be applied to the text pasted, as well as applying Styles for already existing Text Layers.</li>\
        <li>Store and edit text within Photoshop</li>\
        <li>Create Text Layers from Lines of text you specify and place it by the center of Selected Area.</li>\
        <li>Align existing Text Layers, quickly change their styles and content.</li>\
        <li>Import and export settings and Styles as a JSON file. That could be useful for importing the settings after Photoshop‚Äôs been reinstalled, or to share your settings with others‚Äô.</li></ul>\

    <h3>Style List:</h3>\
    <p>How to create a new Style:</p>\
        <ul><li>Click "üû• Add Style" in the lower half of the extension window.</li>\
        <li>Type the Style name in the new window (e.g. regular, scream, SFX etc).</li>\
        <li>Set up the Style options with one of the following 2 methods: select a Text Layer with the style you need and click "‚ùê Copy Layer Style", or specify the settings manually in the form below that button.</li>\
        <li>You can specify Style Tags (separate them using Space) for automatic Style setting. If any Line begins with one of the Style Tags, then the mentioned Style will be selected automatically, while for the Tag not being present in the Layer.</li>\
        <li>You can specify the Tag color for each Style, and colored Tags will be highlighted in the text.</li>\
        <li>Click "Save".</li></ul>\
    <p>You can edit Styles, delete them and change their order by dragging them. If you click on the Style, it will become active and get highlighted with blue color.</p>\
    <p>By clicking arrow ‚ßÅ near a Style, you can apply it to the current Text Layer.</p>\
    <p>You can group Styles into folders which you can also edit, sort and delete. Deleting a folder results in moving its Styles into "Unsorted" section.</p>\
    <h3>Text Block:</h3>\
    <p>Typed or pasted text is automatically divided by lines. One of the Lines gets selected as active. It is highlighted with blue color and you can see its content in the Preview Zone in the upper section of the extension window.</p>\
    <p>In order to select any Line as active, click ‚≠ó on its left. Also you may use  "Previous ‚áß", and "Next ‚á©" buttons by the left of the Preview Zone.</p>\
    <p>If a Line begins with one of the Style Tags (the said tag is highlighted with a color), the Style gets applied if you select the Line. If there is a Default Style (which you can set in Settings) specified, then, if a Line has no Style Tag, the Default Style is applied to the Line.</p>\
    <p>Empty Lines are highlighted with gray color and get ignored while you are navigating the text. You can also set Tags for ignoring non-empty Lines (such as page pointers or translator‚Äôs notes).</p>\
    <p>By clicking arrow ‚ßÅ by the left of a Line, its text will be pasted in the active Text Layer. Style Tags will not be included to the text pasted. Style of the text will not be modified, however if the Layer is empty then Photoshop default style will be applied.</p>\
    <h3>Preview Zone:</h3>\
    <p>Preview Zone displays contents of the active Line with an active Style applied to it. You can see the following information above: number of the active Line, name of the active Style and font size scaling.</p>\
    <p>With scaling you can change the size of pasted text without affecting Style parameters. For example, when working with small scans you can set scaling to 50% which will make any pasted text two times smaller than it is set in Style.</p>\
    <p>If not specified, font size is set to according what was specified in the current Style. If you change its size, it will be used as long as you haven‚Äôt chosen an other Style.</p>\
    <p>By clicking arrow ‚ßÅ, the text with the Style will be applied to the current Text Layer (keyboard shortcut: <b>Win + Shift</b>). The next Line will be set active.</p>\
    <h3>Pasting and Aligning:</h3>\
    <p>Select an Area with "Rectangular Marquee", "Lasso", "Magic Wand" or any other tool. The Selected Area could have any shape, only the 4 extreme points are taken into account. Then click one of the following buttons:</p>\
        <ul><li>"Paste" - a new Text Layer, consisting of the active Line with the active Style, will be created in the middle of the Selected Area. The next Line will be set active.</li>\
        <li>"Align" - the current Text Layer will be aligned by the center of the Selected Area.</li></ul>\
    <p>There are keyboard shortcuts designed for quick performing of the said actions: <b>Win + Ctrl</b> for "Paste" and <b>Win + Alt</b> for "Align".</p>
